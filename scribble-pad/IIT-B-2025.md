title: Scribble Pad at IIT-B - AI Edition üí°
description: Participate in Intense Hackathon in JavaScript for AI from 5th February to 16th February, 2025
---
Are you ready to push the boundaries of AI, WebAssembly, and Scientific Computing? The Scribble Pad Hackathon challenges you to build groundbreaking deep-tech solutions entirely in JavaScript and WebAssembly. From tree ensemble learning models to LLMs in the browser, from Stable Diffusion frameworks to high-performance scientific computing, this is your chance to work on cutting-edge technologies. Collaborate with peers, build open-source tools, and showcase your innovations in a Scribbler Notebook. With prize money, certificates, and networking opportunities, this is the perfect stage to learn, create, and compete! 

**Watchout this space for link to register.**

## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Framework for AI Agents in JavaScript:
**Goal:** Create an easy-to-use framework for building AI agents in JavaScript, focusing on decision-making, learning, and interaction.
***Techniques:***
- Modular Components: For decision-making, learning, and interaction.
- Reinforcement Learning: Methods like Q-Learning for autonomy.
- LLM  Integration: For chatbots and voice assistants.
- Multi-agent Systems: Collaboration/competition among agents.
- Simulation Tools: For environment interaction and testing.

### Problem 2: Tree Ensemble Learning Model (like LightGBM or Catboost) in JavaScript:
**Goal:** Create a tree-based machine learning model that can be used both in Node.js and the browser. It should work efficiently and can be written directly in JavaScript or via a C implementation ported through WebAssembly (WASM).
**Techniques:** Participants could explore:
- Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting for implementing ensemble models.
- WASM for optimizing performance (potentially using libraries like emscripten to port C++ code).
- WebGPU for leveraging hardware acceleration.
- Libraries/Tools: TensorFlow.js, Brain.js, or directly manipulating decision trees with JavaScript.

### Problem 3: Voice Gen in the Browser:
**Goal:** Build a library to load and run multi-model voice-gen in the browser using WASM and WebGPU for performance optimization.
**Techniques:** Focus on:
- Model Quantization to reduce model size for the browser.
- WebAssembly (WASM) for the core computation.
- WebGPU for accelerating model inference on GPUs.
- Participants could explore existing libraries like webgpu and onnxruntime-web for loading models in the browser.

### Problem 4: Library for Doing Scientific Computing (Bioinformatics/CFD/Electromagnetic Simulations/Mechanical Simulations):
**Goal:** Build a library in JavaScript that handles advanced scientific computations, particularly in fields like bioinformatics, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), electromagnetics, and mechanical simulations.
**Techniques:**
- Implement mathematical solvers (Finite Element Method, Fast Fourier Transform, etc.).
- Use WebAssembly for intensive computations, especially for fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and simulations.
- Explore JavaScript libraries like math.js or custom solutions for matrix operations, differential equations, and data manipulation.
