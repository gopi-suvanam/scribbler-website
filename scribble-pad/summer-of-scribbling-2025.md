## 🎯 Themes

Choose any of the following themes for your submission:

### 🧠 1. AI (API or In-Browser)

Participants can:

* Use **AI APIs** (like OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace Inference API, AssemblyAI, etc.)
* Or run models **fully in-browser** (e.g., WebLLM, TensorFlow.js, ONNX.js) for a **bonus**.

#### 🔹 Theme Ideas:

| **Project Idea**          | **Description**                                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EmotionCam**            | Use webcam and either an API (e.g., Affectiva) or browser ML to detect facial emotions. |
| **Ask My Doc**            | Upload a PDF and ask questions via LLM (OpenAI API or WebLLM).                       |
| **Smart Summarizer**      | Paste an article or video transcript → get summary + key points.                    |
| **Voice Commands Bot**    | Use browser mic + API (e.g., Whisper) to recognize voice commands and reply via LLM. |
| **Chat with Spreadsheet** | Upload Excel/CSV and query it using an API-backed LLM (like GPT).                   |
| **Browser Tutor (Bonus)** | A tutor bot that runs *entirely* in the browser using WebLLM + math.js.             |
| **In-Browser Classifier** | Use TensorFlow.js to build a working image or gesture classifier.                   |
| **Hybrid AI Agent**       | Use both browser and API AI — e.g., do vision in-browser, NLP via API.              |

#### 🎁 Bonus Points: Fully browser-based AI using WebGPU/WASM, etc.

### 📊 2. Dashboarding & Visualization

Use Plotly.js, D3, Chart.js, ObservablePlot, or WebGL-powered visualizations.

#### 🔹 Theme Ideas:

* **Smart City Dashboard**: Combine open datasets (air quality, traffic, weather) into a live dashboard.  
* **Crypto Tracker**: Live charts of top coins, sentiment analysis of news/Twitter, and prediction trends.  
* **Personal Health Tracker**: Allow users to input or import fitness/health data and visualize trends.  
* **Startup Metrics**: Simulate or import mock metrics for user growth, churn, revenue, and visualize with cohort analysis.  
* **Election Pulse**: Build a polling dashboard with real-time visualizations and projections.

### 🕶️ 3. XR (Extended Reality in Browser)

Use face-api.js, TensorFlow.js, WebXR, Three.js, A-Frame, or AR.js.

#### 🔹 Theme Ideas:

* **Try-on Filters**: Real-time face tracking with filters, masks, and effects — like Snap or Insta, but in a notebook!  
* **AR Info Cards**: Point camera at objects (e.g., books, plants) and display interactive labels or facts.  
* **3D Math Visualizer**: Use A-Frame to render 3D plots or vector operations in real space.  
* **Virtual Whiteboard**: Collaborative whiteboard inside Scribbler using Three.js and drawing APIs.  
* **Face-Controlled Games**: Build simple browser games controlled by head movement or eye blink.
