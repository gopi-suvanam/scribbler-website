title: Your Side Project Deserves a Notebook, Not a Repo
description: Repos are great for deployment, but for ideation? They fail to tell the story. Notebooks —whether in Scribbler or Jupyter- help you code with context, ensuring your side project grows organically and remains understandable months later.

**TL;DR:** Repos are where code goes to sleep. Notebooks are where ideas come alive. If you’re hacking on a side project nights & weekends, you don’t need a perfect dependency tree — you need a fast, writable, runnable scratchpad where code, notes, experiments, AI help, and shareable demos live together. That’s why we built **Scribbler**.

## Why “just throw it in a repo” slows builders down

Open a blank GitHub repo and what happens? You start thinking about: folder structure, build tools, lint rules, CI, README formatting, package managers, version bumps… and suddenly you’re doing plumbing instead of prototyping. For side projects — especially exploratory ones — front‑loading infrastructure is creative friction. Many promising ideas stall right here.

A **notebook‑first workflow** flips that script. Instead of proving you can ship a production system, you prove the *idea* — in code you can run right now, right next to the explanation of what you were trying to learn, test, or validate.

### Notebooks: Code + Context in the Same Place

Builders rarely remember *why* past‑you wrote that function. A notebook keeps the “what” and the “why” glued together:

* **Markdown blocks** capture intent, decisions, and TODOs.
* **Executable code cells** show the current state of an experiment.
* **Outputs inline**: logs, tables, DOM snippets, charts.
* **Easy branching**: duplicate a notebook, try a wild idea, compare results.

Compare that to digging through `/src/experimental/v2-old/try-3-final-really` branches in a repo. With notebooks, yesterday’s thinking is visible and runnable.

## **Your Side Project Deserves a Notebook, Not a Repo**

When you kick off a side project—whether it’s tinkering with APIs, crafting small JavaScript tools, or diving into data—your first instinct might be to `git init` and create a bare repo. But too often, that repo becomes dusty docs, fragmented scripts, and forgotten READMEs. What if you started with a **notebook** instead?


### 🎯 A Notebook Is a Narrative-First Approach

Many Scribbler articles underscore this philosophy:
* [**Scribbler – A JavaScript Notebook Tool as an Alternative to MATLAB**](/2024/07/08/Scribbler-As-JavaScript-Alternative-to-Matlab.html)
* [**Powering Up Scribbler Notebooks with ESM Module**](/2025/06/15/Power-up-Scribbler-Notebooks-with-ESM-Modules.html)
* [**Boosting Scribbler with External, CDN‑Hosted, ES‑6 Libraries**](/2024/12/26/Scribbler-with-ES-6-Libraries.html)
* [**Publishing JavaScript Application Using Scribbler – A Step‑by‑Step Guide**](/2025/01/06/Publishing-JavaScript-Application-on-Scribbler.html)

These pieces show how Scribbler makes experimentation central, keeping code and reasoning in one interactive space.


### 📚 Rooted in Literate Programming

This notebook‑centric mindset has deep philosophical roots:

* [**Donald Knuth’s Literate Programming (1984)**](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)
* [Wikipedia: Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)

Knuth believed programs should be written as works of literature for humans first, computers second. Modern notebooks like Jupyter follow that ethos.


### 🔍 Jupyter and Literate Computing

Jupyter popularized **literate computing**, combining Markdown, math, and executable code:

* [Medium: Literate Programming Using Jupyter Notebook](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/literate-programming-using-jupyter-notebook-4c2520d71597)
* [Research paper: Pimentel et al. on Jupyter as Literate Programming](https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf)


### 🧠 Why Notebooks Fit Side Projects Perfectly

| Advantage                    | ‍Why It Matters for a Side Project                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Narrative-driven flow**    | Capture your thought process—not just final code.       |
| **Interactive exploration**  | Run experiments, tweak parameters, visualize instantly. |
| **Self-documenting history** | Keep text, code, and outputs together.                  |
| **Easy sharing**             | Export to HTML, PDF, or publish as live docs.           |




## The Side Project Reality: Momentum > Architecture

Most side projects die from lost momentum, not bad architecture. A notebook lowers the activation energy:

* Start with a quick Markdown note: *“Idea: tiny AI‑powered regex tester.”*
* Add a code cell, import a library from CDN, test it.
* Screenshot + share to Twitter for feedback.
* Iterate *before* you scaffold a full app.

When (not if) the idea takes off, *then* formalize the repo. Until then, optimize for **speed of iteration + shareability**.


### Where AI Supercharges Notebook‑First Building

AI in Scribbler isn’t a gimmick — it’s a multiplier when you’re moving fast:

* **Generate starter code** for a widget, API call, or visualization from a Markdown note.
* **Explain errors in context** using the current cell state.
* **Refactor or translate snippets** (ES module → CommonJS, browser → Node mock, etc.).
* **Summarize a messy notebook** into bullet points or a README draft.

Because the AI sees *your code and your commentary in one place*, it can give more relevant answers than when you paste fragments into a chat box.

### From Notebook to Repo — When You’re Ready

A notebook‑first flow doesn’t replace repos; it *feeds* them. When your experiment proves real value:

1. Extract stable modules.
2. Promote rough notes into documentation.
3. Generate test stubs from working notebook code.
4. Link the original notebook in the repo’s `/examples` or `/docs` folder so future contributors see the origin story.

## To Summarize

Your side project doesn’t need another empty repo — it needs a **creative workbench**. A space where you can think in Markdown, test in JavaScript, pull in AI when stuck, and share progress before the idea goes stale.

**Start in a notebook. Ship faster. Learn in public.** When it’s real, *then* give it a repo.
